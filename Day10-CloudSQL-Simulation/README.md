# Day 10 â€“ Cloud SQL Simulation

Used SQLite to simulate a cloud database system  
Created a `users` table with ID, email, and access_level  
Inserted multiple records  
Queried the database using SQL to filter admin-level access

## SQL Used:
- CREATE TABLE
- INSERT INTO
- SELECT *
- WHERE

## Reflection:
This exercise helped me understand how Google Cloud SQL and AWS RDS store and query data for cloud applications. I practiced real SQL queries that can power authentication, IAM, and access controls.
