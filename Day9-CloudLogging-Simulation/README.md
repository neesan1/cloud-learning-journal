# Day 9 – Cloud Logging Simulation

Simulated cloud-style logging by creating a `system.log` file  
Used `grep` to filter by log level: ERROR, WARNING, INFO  
Appended new logs using `echo` and timestamp  
Practiced log inspection and basic monitoring

##Commands Used:
- echo
- nano
- grep
- tail

## Reflection:
Today’s simulation showed me how cloud systems track and filter events using log files. These concepts are used by Google Cloud Logging, AWS CloudWatch, and Azure Monitor to monitor infrastructure health, errors, and security events.
