# Day 3 – Simulating Virtual Machines in Linux

Simulated a cloud virtual machine terminal using Webminal  
Created a fake install script with bash  
Ran it using both `bash` and `chmod +x` techniques  
Created log files and used commands like `cat`, `grep`, `uname`, and `uptime`  
Practiced core system operations like those used in GCP Compute Engine

## Commands Used:
- mkdir
- echo
- chmod
- touch
- bash script.sh
- cat
- grep
- whoami
- uname
- date
- uptime

## Reflection:
Today I experienced what it's like to work inside a virtual machine environment using the Linux CLI. I learned how to simulate installs, monitor system status, and manage log files — the exact skills used by DevOps and cloud engineers in the real world.
