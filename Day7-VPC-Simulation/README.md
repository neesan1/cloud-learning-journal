# Day 7 â€“ VPC & Firewall Simulation

Simulated a basic VPC structure using folders:
- my_vpc/
- subnet-a/
- vm.txt
- subnet-b/

#Used `chmod` to simulate firewall rules that deny unauthorized access.
#Accessing `vm.txt` from subnet-b results in permission denied.

## Commands Used:
- mkdir
- chmod
- echo
- cat

## Reflection:
This helped me understand how cloud networking uses subnets and firewall rules to isolate resources across zones.
