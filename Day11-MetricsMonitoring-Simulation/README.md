# Day 11 – Cloud Monitoring & Metrics Simulation

Simulated cloud-style VM monitoring  
Collected CPU load and memory usage with `uptime` and `free -m`  
Logged metrics to `metrics.log`  
Simulated alerting when memory dropped below threshold (300MB)

## Tools Used:
- top
- uptime
- free -m
- bash conditions
- echo + log file

## Reflection:
This helped me understand how Google Cloud Monitoring and AWS CloudWatch work behind the scenes — tracking performance, logging metrics, and alerting engineers when system thresholds are passed.
