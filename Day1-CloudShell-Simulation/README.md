# Day 1 – Simulated GCP: Cloud Shell & Storage

 Used a Linux terminal on Webminal to simulate Google Cloud  
 Created a project folder: `cloud_project`  
 Simulated a Cloud Storage bucket using a folder  
 Created a file: `hello.txt`  
 Uploaded the file into the bucket using `cp`  
 Verified the file with `ls`

## Commands Used:
- mkdir
- echo
- cp
- ls
- pwd

## Reflection:
Today I simulated what it’s like to work in Google Cloud using the command line. I now understand the flow of creating cloud resources and uploading data — even without a cloud account. Looking forward to building real-world cloud projects next!
