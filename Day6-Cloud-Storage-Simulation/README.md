# Day 6 â€“ Cloud Storage Simulation (Without Real Cloud)

Simulated cloud storage behavior using folders and permissions:
Created cloud-style bucket using `mkdir`
Uploaded and versioned files using `cp`
Simulated public and private file access using `chmod`
Practiced downloading (copying) files from cloud


## Commands Used

mkdir ~/cloud_bucket
echo "text" > file.txt
cp file.txt ~/cloud_bucket/
chmod 700 file.txt
ls -l

 Reflection:
This simulation helped me understand how cloud storage works behind the scenes. I practiced creating buckets, uploading/versioning files, simulating file permissions, and copying (downloading) data. These are foundational operations in services like Google Cloud Storage or AWS S3.
